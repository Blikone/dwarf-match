#Dwarf Match

In this project you will be building an angular controller for
a familiar card game with a fantasy twist!

Most of the legwork has already been completed,
You don't need to worry about how the cards animate,
or putting the cards on the screen. All we need to
worry about is the game logic and telling the cards
when to flip over.

Loading up our game as-is will simply display a grid
of face down cards. Clicking on them doesn't do anything.
Let's change that!

1. Lets open up the index.html and take a look
at how our cards are displayed
..* _Hint: check the card class_
2. We have an idea of how to flip the card now,
but we have some groundwork to lay first. Lets open up
game-controller.js and follow the first comment
